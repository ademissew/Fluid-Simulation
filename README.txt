Hi, welcome to my code. Here are some FAQs:

1. How do you compile and run my code?
  $ cd solution
  Then you can run the code using the following command:
  $ ./a3 <character> <h>

where the characters are e (Forward Euler), t (Trapazoidal), and r (Runge-Kutta 4), which represent the time stepping method and h is the step size.

I recommend using r (or t but r is nicer looking) with a time step of 0.01.


2. Did I collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, with whom and of what?
Yes, I worked collaborated with Jeff Chow. We also went through the notes together, whenever one of us got stuck on something, the other would help explain a concept or help debug.

3. Did you use any helpful references?
I used the lecture slides and piazza posts.

4. Are there any problems with your code/what are they?
 Not that I know of.

5. Did you do any of the extra credit? 
  Nope.

6. Comments
I thought the pset was pretty cool and straightforward, especially once I got it working correctly!
